# DCU Intelligent Assistant

## Overview

DCU Intelligent Assistant is an android app which provides useful college services including:
- the ability to find class timetables using a course code and date
- an interactive map of DCU to search for buildings in DCU
- an assignments page for creating and saving reminders for assignments
- a transport page for finding bus timetables for bus stops near DCU or for any bus number

All of these features can be accessed through an AI chatbot. For example, sending the message "What are my classes today?" to it will open up a page displaying your class timetable.
